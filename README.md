### Reflections
While I have a whole file chronicling the journey of my implementation, I thought I would sum up the experience a little more concisely.

I thought I was off to a good start intially, but the path I ended up on was fraught, and I should have more clearly thought through my abstractions in the beginning.

While the cost of abstractions can be more verbosity in code, it pays off when putting everything together to accomplish a goal. I think this is really what I learned from approaching my `Movement` the way I did in stale/movement compared to the reimagined approach I ended up taking.

With the right abstractions, the final integration was much more straightforward.

### TODO
* Consider implementing a PGN-like game history inside the `Chess` class.
